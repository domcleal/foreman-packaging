%description
Software Collection repositories provide additional sets of software packages,
typically newer versions than those available in an OS distribution.

This meta-package depends on those packages that contain the Yum repository
configuration files required for Foreman.  It's designed for use on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux rebuilds, such as CentOS.
